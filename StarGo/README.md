# StarGo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## The app development rules
The app will be using  “Flutter ScreenUtil” package to ensure the app design is consistent across all mobile devices.
The app will be developed using “Stacked” architecture.
Font size will scale according to the device’s accessibility setting “font size”.
We will be using Travis CI and others to checkmate us when we push, so as we don’t push code with bugs or errors.
The layout of the codebase will just implement stacked architecture .
